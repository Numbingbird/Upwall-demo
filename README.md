# Upwall-demo
Code samples and demo reels for Upwall

This is an indefinitely suspended, half-finished Unity game.
It was about climbing upwards using only a grappling hook for movement.
Gameplay videos are available in base directory.
Files copied verbatim from private project.

The project contains many of the base features shared between games. Specifically, this covers options such as audio, main menu, pause, control rebinding, language, fullscreen, and save/load. Aside from options, some interactable UI elements are also demonstrated. All of these features listed are reusable (modular).

Personal Unity Project in C#
Developer, Designer, Artist
Sole developer on project. Implemented accessibility options, state machine behaviours, modular object design, and optimized runtime effiency. Achieved modularity on function-level by utilizing delegates. Combined function-level modularity with state machine pattern for independently modular state behaviours. This allowed for exponential combinations of functions and kept relevant code blocks grouped.
Created all sprite art, animation, UI, tilemaps, and shaders. Information displayed is independent of resolution ratio.
